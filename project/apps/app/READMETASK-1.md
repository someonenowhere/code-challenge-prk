Question 1: How did you manage to fetch the list and what tool did you use?
   Answer : To fetch the list of Pokémon, I used the axios library, which is a popular tool for making HTTP requests. Specifically, I used the
   axios.get() method to send a GET request to the Pokémon API, which returns a list of Pokémon in JSON format.

Question 2: What steps would you take to future improve this?
   Answer : To future improve this code, I would take the following steps:
   Implement error handling: While I've added some basic error handling using try/catch blocks, I could improve this by providing more specific error messages and handling different types of errors (e.g., network errors, API errors).
   Add caching: To improve performance, I could implement caching using a library like react-query.
